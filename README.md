# glwrap

Wraps common webgl tasks into js classes for convenience.
The aim is to have an adequate base for webgl experiments 
that do not require or benefit from using a massive library like THREEJS.

This library just contains the basic components of a rendering engine rather than being one.
So you will have to setup your own mainloop and rendering pipeline.

also includes 3D math functions from gl-matrix library.
