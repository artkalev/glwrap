GLWrap

Wraps common webgl tasks into js classes for convenience.

The aim is to have an adequate base for webgl experiments 
that do not require or benefit from using a massive library like THREEJS.

The classes are designed to be functional independently.

This is not a webgl rendering engine!
It is a collection of flexible and easily extendable core components whith which to build a robust engine.
