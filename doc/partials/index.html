<p>Wraps common webgl tasks into js classes for convenience.</p>
<p>The aim is to have an adequate base for webgl experiments 
that do not require or benefit from using a massive library like THREEJS.</p>
<p>This library just contains the basic components of a rendering engine rather than being one.</p>
<p>So you will have to setup your own mainloop and rendering pipeline.</p>
<p>also includes 3D math functions from gl-matrix library.</p>
